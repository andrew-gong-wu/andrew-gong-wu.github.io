        Below I have annotated an <a href="https://andrewwu.substack.com/p/poetry">essay</a> I wrote in December 2023. If you hover over words and they turn gray, you can click on them and an annotation explaining my thought process will pop up on the right. I do recommend reading the essay without annotations first, though!

        I wrote this essay because I was in the midst of a difficult <a href="college-consulting.html">college consulting</a> season, and I wanted to see how my students felt. If for some silly reason I had been forced to once again undergo the American application process, this would have been my Common App. Enjoy!

        <p>
          Why play music written by <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="1">living friends rather than dead strangers</span>?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, you can <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="2">cuss them out to their faces</span>. Honestly, <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="3">Holden</span> deserved it all. His <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="4">five-movement piano suite <i>Poetry</i></span> was twenty-three minutes of his various idiosyncrasies, which often bordered on insanity—and I was its first (and so far only!) victim.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="5">Triple-octave jumps at the tempo marking “≥176”; multiple lines notated in four staves (the standard being two); a five-minute postlude comprising a single pianissimo chord repeated 90 times.</span> <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="6">Insanity</span>, then, that I loved <i>Poetry</i> as much as I did, <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="7">that I loved <i>Poetry</i></span> more than I’ve loved any other piece of music—in part because playing <i>Poetry</i> was <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="8">the first time I’ve felt real ownership of my art</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="9">Young classical pianists begin with the basics—Bach, Beethoven, Chopin—and the adventurous among us experiment with the esoteric—Saariaho, Takemitsu, Gubaidulina</span>. <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="16">We</span> first encounter pieces through famous recordings, or if we’re lucky, live concerts. We scaffold our learning by researching historical context and conducting harmonic and structural analyses: <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="10">all to answer the question <i>how should I play this?</i>, which often flattens into the drier, more academic <i>how should this be played?</i>, or its closest proxy, <i>how do the best pianists play this?</i></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Intellectually, I appreciated the rigor in crafting a “good” interpretation. But emotionally, I <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="11">grappled with the <i>point</i> of spending months and months precision-drilling difficult passages</span>, scouring YouTube to study recordings, <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="12">driving myself half-mad</span> over <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="13"><i>this note’s not crisp enough</i> or <i>that chord needs more pinky</i></span>—<span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="14">all to play a piece worse than any professional would</span>. None of it mattered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="15">And thus for many years I believed myself less a pianist and more a plagiarist, realizing amateurish amalgams of renditions I admired, borrowing and blending my idols’ best ideas with but an iota of their talent and technique</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="17">So <i>Poetry</i> was special</span>. Knowing <i>no one else has done this before</i> fueled me to learn <i>Poetry</i> more deeply and intimately than any of my other repertoire. I <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="18">replaced warm-up scales with slow-motion jumps</span>; <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="19">scribbled in fingering “solutions” for that four-staff section</span>; and <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="20">most importantly, texted Holden whenever I wanted to complain</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          And I did it all <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="21">without reference recordings, without cultural conceptions</span> of <i>this composer must be played in this way</i>—with confidence that my choices were <i>mine</i> and not the product of <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="22">conscious or subconscious imitation</span>. <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="23">What I did mattered</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="24">Music conveys things we don’t or can’t say with just words</span>. I <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="25">so dearly wish I could staple these sounds</span>, <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="26">from the <i>Prelude</i>’s delirious dissonances to the <i>Scherzo</i>’s ecstatic climaxes</span>, to my words. <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="27">I’d tell you <i>listen for how these melodic fragments appear in the bass</i> or <i>it’s crazy how Holden pulls off this transition</i></span>. I’d gush about those <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="28">whole-tone scales</span> and <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="29">thirteenth chords</span>, about <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="30">how the first movement is a microcosm of the last four in reverse</span>. <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="31">The right passages would fill your ears and you’d understand why I love <i>Poetry</i> so much—</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="32">—but I can’t</span>. <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="33">And even if I could, some things would still never make sense to you</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Music emerges from how sound <i>interacts with</i> a listener’s <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="35">lived experiences, surroundings, and emotional state</span>. Anybody can say <i>Poetry</i> sounds good. <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="34">Only I can say</span> <i>Poetry was the first piece in my sixteen years of learning piano that made me feel like a real musician</i>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So: Last May, <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="36">at midnight, playing the <i>Postlude</i> in a dimly-lit room</span>, <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="37">buried under the weight of each and every one of those ninety listless, unsettling, pianissimo chords</span>, enduring that <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="38">lonely</span>, oppressive eternity—<span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="39">nobody, <i>nobody</i> else will ever know exactly how that feels</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Most people wouldn’t want to hear those chords for five minutes. But that night I could have lost myself there for <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="40">five hundred centuries</span>. Most people would think that’s <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="41">insane</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="42">I think that’s beautiful.</span>
