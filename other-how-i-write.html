        Below I have annotated an <a href="https://andrewwu.substack.com/p/poetry">essay</a> I wrote in December 2023. If you hover over words and they turn gray, you can click on them and an annotation explaining my thought process will pop up on the right. I do recommend reading the essay without annotations first, though!
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote this essay because I was in the midst of a difficult <a href="college-consulting.html">college consulting</a> season, and I wanted to see how my students felt. If for some silly reason I had been forced to once again undergo the American application process, this would have been my Common App. Enjoy!

      <div class="essay">
        <p>
          Why play music written by <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="1">living friends rather than dead strangers</span>?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, you can <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="2">cuss them out to their faces</span>. Honestly, <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="3">Holden</span> deserved it all. His <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="4">five-movement piano suite <i>Poetry</i></span> was twenty-three minutes of his various idiosyncrasies, which often bordered on insanity—and I was its first (and so far only!) victim.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="5">Triple-octave jumps at the tempo marking “≥176”; multiple lines notated in four staves (the standard being two); a five-minute postlude comprising a single pianissimo chord repeated 90 times.</span> <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="6">Insanity</span>, then, that I loved <i>Poetry</i> as much as I did, <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="7">that I loved <i>Poetry</i></span> more than I’ve loved any other piece of music—in part because playing <i>Poetry</i> was <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="8">the first time I’ve felt real ownership of my art</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="9">Young classical pianists begin with the basics—Bach, Beethoven, Chopin—and the adventurous among us experiment with the esoteric—Saariaho, Takemitsu, Gubaidulina</span>. <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="16">We</span> first encounter pieces through famous recordings, or if we’re lucky, live concerts. We scaffold our learning by researching historical context and conducting harmonic and structural analyses: <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="10">all to answer the question <i>how should I play this?</i>, which often flattens into the drier, more academic <i>how should this be played?</i>, or its closest proxy, <i>how do the best pianists play this?</i></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Intellectually, I appreciated the rigor in crafting a “good” interpretation. But emotionally, I <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="11">grappled with the <i>point</i> of spending months and months precision-drilling difficult passages</span>, scouring YouTube to study recordings, <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="12">driving myself half-mad</span> over <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="13"><i>this note’s not crisp enough</i> or <i>that chord needs more pinky</i></span>—<span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="14">all to play a piece worse than any professional would</span>. None of it mattered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="15">And thus for many years I believed myself less a pianist and more a plagiarist, realizing amateurish amalgams of renditions I admired, borrowing and blending my idols’ best ideas with but an iota of their talent and technique</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="17">So <i>Poetry</i> was special</span>. Knowing <i>no one else has done this before</i> fueled me to learn <i>Poetry</i> more deeply and intimately than any of my other repertoire. I <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="18">replaced warm-up scales with slow-motion jumps</span>; <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="19">scribbled in fingering “solutions” for that four-staff section</span>; and <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="20">most importantly, texted Holden whenever I wanted to complain</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          And I did it all <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="21">without reference recordings, without cultural conceptions</span> of <i>this composer must be played in this way</i>—with confidence that my choices were <i>mine</i> and not the product of <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="22">conscious or subconscious imitation</span>. <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="23">What I did mattered</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="24">Music conveys things we don’t or can’t say with just words</span>. I <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="25">so dearly wish I could staple these sounds</span>, <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="26">from the <i>Prelude</i>’s delirious dissonances to the <i>Scherzo</i>’s ecstatic climaxes</span>, to my words. <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="27">I’d tell you <i>listen for how these melodic fragments appear in the bass</i> or <i>it’s crazy how Holden pulls off this transition</i></span>. I’d gush about those <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="28">whole-tone scales</span> and <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="29">thirteenth chords</span>, about <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="30">how the first movement is a microcosm of the last four in reverse</span>. <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="31">The right passages would fill your ears and you’d understand why I love <i>Poetry</i> so much—</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="32">—but I can’t</span>. <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="33">And even if I could, some things would still never make sense to you</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Music emerges from how sound <i>interacts with</i> a listener’s <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="35">lived experiences, surroundings, and emotional state</span>. Anybody can say <i>Poetry</i> sounds good. <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="34">Only I can say</span> <i>Poetry was the first piece in my sixteen years of learning piano that made me feel like a real musician</i>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So: Last May, <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="36">at midnight, playing the <i>Postlude</i> in a dimly-lit room</span>, <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="37">buried under the weight of each and every one of those ninety listless, unsettling, pianissimo chords</span>, enduring that <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="38">lonely</span>, oppressive eternity—<span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="39">nobody, <i>nobody</i> else will ever know exactly how that feels</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Most people wouldn’t want to hear those chords for five minutes. But that night I could have lost myself there for <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="40">five hundred centuries</span>. Most people would think that’s <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="41">insane</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="annotation" data-annotation-id="42">I think that’s beautiful.</span>

      // JavaScript code to handle annotations
      const annotations = { 
        1: "Start with a bang. Reel them in. There are countless bad metaphors about beginnings, but they all express the same thing.", // JS object - works like a dictionary. key/value
        2: "Subversion of expectations!",
        3: "A lot of people introduce characters awkwardly. No need to be clumsy. Just shove them in there; it's obvious Holden is my living composer friend whom I regularly cuss out.",
        4: "Similar to my note on introducing people: I think this is a relatively artful way to introduce the (musical) piece.",
        5: "There's a lot of power in introducing specifics. First, they lend your writing legitimacy: when a reader goes through this sentence, they can rest assured that I am a real pianist navigating real difficulties (insanities, perhaps.) Moreover, they give me something to refer back to later. <br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/AkAlRaZO_Zs?feature=shared&t=1007\">Triple-octave jumps (though he later changed the metronome marking)</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AkAlRaZO_Zs?feature=shared&t=128\">four staves</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AkAlRaZO_Zs?feature=shared&t=1132\">postlude</a>.",
        6: "I care a lot about structural integrity. Bigger examples later, but even little things like the repetition of 'insanity' from paragraph to paragraph make the essay more cohesive.",
        7: "Exact repetition for emphasis. Word and phrases gain power as you repeat them.",
        8: "A big moment, and it is in some sense the thesis of the entire essay. It's the first time I really answer the question 'why play music written by living friends rather than dead strangers?'—everything else has been complaints and jokes. <br><br>It also marks the end of the 'introduction' arc of the essay, roughly speaking.",
        9: "I love alliteration, and I think this sentence (and essay) makes that quite clear. 'Begin' with the 'basics'; 'adventurous among'; 'experiment' with the 'esoteric'. <br><br>Note also that I maintain parallelism—not only is there alliteration, but it also occurs at the same relative position (right before the em dash that sets off composer names.) In a 'two'-flavored sentence (two clauses with similar vibes), there ought to be balance. <br><br>Finally, there's nothing wrong with writing things your readers won't know. That most people have not heard of Saariaho, Takemitsu, and Gubaidulina is an advantage; that's the intent, given that most people know who Bach, Beethoven, and Chopin are.",
        10: "Everyone should use italics. It's a great tool. Note how I get from one phrase to the next: first, I cut out the 'I'; then, I introduce other pianists, when previously I was working with theoretical 'should's. Finally, simplicity is your friend. I repeat the words 'how', 'play,' and 'this,' and that helps anchor the reader. No need for complicated rewordings!",
        11: "This is a nice string of 'p' and 'd' sounds—alliteration and consonance. 'Gra<i>pp</i>le<i>d</i> with the <i>p</i>oint of s<i>p</i>en<i>d</i>ing months and months <i>p</i>recision-<i>d</i>rilling <i>d</i>ifficult <i>p</i>assages.' I like it when words sound and look good.",
        12: "Another nice moment, similar to the previous annotation. '<i>D</i>riving <i>m</i>ysel<i>f</i> hal<i>f</i>-<i>m</i>a<i>d</i>.'",
        13: "Conveying the idea of 'driving myself half-mad' doesn't even require specifics here: I can get away with just gesturing at them!",
        14: "I haven't talked much about pace yet, but now's a good time. In this sentence, I've built up to a mini-climax of sorts. 'Precision-drilling difficult passages' is four words; 'scouring YouTube to study recordings,' five; 'driving myself half-mad over <i>this note’s not crisp enough</i> or <i>that chord needs more pinky</i>,' many. In 'three'-flavored sentences, this is a general rule: smaller to bigger. Then, I let the reader hang for a moment at the em dash—and fall back to earth. <br><br>There's no point. I'm just worse than all the professionals.",
        15: "This was the first sentence I wrote for this piece, and for a few weeks, I intended to start the essay with this sentence (or some variant.) <br><br>I chose here to isolate it in a single paragraph due to its complexity and weight. Complexity: sentence length, depth. Weight: length of time—years. <br><br>And the alliteration contributes to the complexity and weight, too. 'Pianist, plagiarist'; 'realizing, renditions'; 'amateurish, amalgams, admired'; 'borrowing, blending, best, but'; 'idols, ideas, iota'; 'talent, technique.' Note that I get some consonance, too—'amateurish, amalgams, admired' all have the 'm'-sound! <br><br>Structurally, it's the climax of this 'pianistic confusion' arc, and allows me to begin talking about <i>Poetry</i> next.",
        16: "A relatively clean way, in my eyes, to talk about both myself and younger pianists in general.",
        17: "Short sentences matter! This essay skews long, in terms of sentence length, but that makes the shorter sentences more powerful in comparison.",
        18: "Refers back to 'triple-octave jumps at the tempo marking '≥176.'' Note also the micro-parallelism and 'm,' 's,' and 'w' sounds: <i>w</i>ar<i>m</i>-up <i>s</i>cale<i>s</i>, <i>s</i>lo<i>w</i>-<i>m</i>otion ju<i>m</i>p<i>s</i>.",
        19: "Refers back to 'multiple lines notated in four staves (the standard being two).' Note also the 's' and 'f' sounds: '<i>s</i>cribbled in <i>f</i>ingering '<i>s</i>olution<i>s</i>' <i>f</i>or that <i>f</i>our-<i>s</i>ta<i>ff</i> <i>s</i>ection.'",
        20: "Another subversion of expectations. Naturally, given that I've referenced 'triple-octave jumps' and the 'multiple lines notated in four staves,' the expectation would be to reference the 'single pianissimo chord repeated 90 times.' Instead, I choose to reference the idea of constantly being annoyed at Holden, which lets me use the <i>Postlude</i> later in this essay. To me, structure is everything!",
        21: "Repetition of this idea of originality, for emphasis. Alliteration to lend strength.",
        22: "Throughout the essay, I feel I've explained the conscious imitation part—'<i>how do the best pianists play this</i>,' 'scouring YouTube to study recordings,' 'amateurish amalgams of renditions I admired.' That being said, it's difficult to condense all your ideas into 650 words. Here I attempted to sneak in the notion that even when the intent is not to study to imitate, our conceptions are irrevocably colored by our first times listening to a piece. But it's a relatively small note.",
        23: "Very overt reference to 'none of it mattered.' Not particularly clever or deep but it gets the job done. This resolves the 'pianistic confusion' arc, so I can now pivot to a different idea.",
        24: "I advise people to never write meta-stuff in their essays: it's cringe. But I think I plausibly get away with it here? Throughout this paragraph, I'm trying to create a sense of 'the author is talking to you, the reader, about this piece and the words he's using to talk about this piece,' and I think it works.",
        25: "Rhythm, and plenty of 's' and 'd' sounds. '<i>S</i>o <i>d</i>early wi<i>s</i>h,' '<i>s</i>taple <i>th</i>e<i>s</i>e <i>s</i>oun<i>ds</i>.' I know 'these' doesn't actually start with 'd,' but it has the same vibe, and also the same vowel as in 'dearly,' too.",
        26: "My best attempt at music without music. I don't think I need to spell out everything going on here—just read it out loud! Rhythm, alliteration, consonance, assonance.",
        27: "The italicized words correspond to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AkAlRaZO_Zs?feature=shared&t=844\">the <i>Peacefully flowing</i> section</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AkAlRaZO_Zs?feature=shared&t=955\">the transition to <i>Majestic</i></a>.",
        28: "See <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AkAlRaZO_Zs?feature=shared&t=713\">here</a>.",
        29: "See <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AkAlRaZO_Zs?feature=shared&t=1005\">here</a>.",
        30: "Explained (somewhat) in <a href=\"https://andrewwu.substack.com/p/music-too-great-to-be-forgotten\">this blog post.</a>",
        31: "Funnily enough, given that I'm annotating this, I do actually get to staple these sounds to my words. Anyway, another long buildup—",
        32: "—into a short letdown.",
        33: "Here I'm using a short paragraph (just one-and-a-half sentences!) to make sure I highlight the idea here: that even if you could hear everything I'm hearing, there's more to what music is.",
        34: "<i>Poetry</i> is a piece only I have learned, and only I have lived with my specific musical confusion, so there are things that only I can say about it. I've been searching for this idea of uniqueness, for my musical voice, throughout the entire essay; it's the same thing here. <br><br>Worth flagging that this relates to 'lived experiences.'",
        35: "Structure matters, so I'm going to reference 'lived experiences, surroundings, and emotional state' sequentially in the next few sentences.",
        36: "Surroundings.",
        37: "I dragged out this phrase because I wanted it to feel long. The shortest possible way of saying it is 'buried under those ninety chords.'",
        38: "Emotional state.",
        39: "The climax and the entire point of the essay. First, I played a piece no one else has played before; now, I explain something no one else will ever experience.",
        40: "The correct amount of time begins with 'five,' and 'five centuries' felt somehow too short. Some of this is just pure vibes.",
        41: "One last instance of this word, which appears at the start.",
        42: "Structurally, it's evidently 'most people,' 'I,' 'most people,' 'I.' I experimented with every possible place to break the paragraph and felt breaking before the final 'I' seemed best. <br><br>Thanks for reading! I hope you have a better sense of how I write now :)"
