        <p>Music—classical piano—is my longest-running hobby.</p>
        <p>Hobby, in that it has never sustained me financially, and in that it is not what I studied as an undergraduate. The word feels unfair. But what words are there for that which you begin at age four and continue for the rest of your life?</p>
        <p>I could say music is my <i>life</i>, but that feels cliche at best, and unimaginably reductive at worst. No, my life has meaning far beyond my music. I could say music is my <i>joy</i>, but in fact it is music that frustrates and angers me most. </p>
